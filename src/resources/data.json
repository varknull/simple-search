Getting into the museum with the fast track entry needs a little work. The meeting spot is great - right across from the museum entrance. But it was also the meeting spot for probably 10 other tours when we were supposed to be there. And trying to distinguish between all of the tours (including several from Get Your Guide) was a little confusing, and could\u0026#039;ve been organized better. Communicating with everyone in the group could\u0026#039;ve been better as well. No explanations were given about what we were doing, so we just had to go with it and hope we didn\u0026#039;t lose the guide who was taking us inside.

Nothing to do with get your guide but itinerary inside the museums is not 100% clear.\nFor the basilica you have to take the right door when exiting the chapelle sistine even though it seems to be reserved for groups. We missed it the first time and had to go back through the museums and the chapelle. Also note that once you exit for the basilica you cannot return to the museums. If you miss the basilica you can always go back by making the way all around the piazza san pietro.","author":"a GetYourGuide customer \u2013 Canada","foreignLanguage":false,"date":"May 26, 2018","date_unformatted":{},"languageCode":"en","traveler_type":"couple","reviewerName":"Benoit","reviewerCountry":"Canada"},{"review_id":2659542,"rating":"5.0","title":"It worked well for easy entry.","message":"","author":"Beverly \u2013 Luxembourg","foreignLanguage":false,"date":"May 26, 2018","date_unformatted":{},"languageCode":"en","traveler_type":"family_young","reviewerName":"Beverly","reviewerCountry":"Luxembourg"},{"review_id":2657658,"rating":"5.0","title":"Worth the money","message":"Queues were awful so we were super glad we paid for this.

The guides were knowledgeable and spoke 5 different languages -- crazy!! They got us in fairly quickly, though there was definitely still a line. However, we went on a Tuesday and the Vatican is closed on Sundays and Mondays, so I think that was why it was so busy that day. Avoid that day if you can help it! This was a self-guided tour, but the Get Your Guide rep was willing to help with audio guides if you wanted them (though I wouldn\u0026#039;t bother -- it\u0026#039;s too loud and busy in the Vatican Museums to hear your audio guide anyway). I would bring a Rick Steves written guide or something similar instead so you can look at the highlights. Make sure to save time for Raphael\u0026#039;s rooms, the Sistine Chapel, and St. Peter\u0026#039;s Basilica -- all of those are at the end of the Vatican Museums self-guided tour.","author":"a GetYourGuide customer","foreignLanguage":false,"date":"October 30, 2017","date_unformatted":{},"languageCode":"en","traveler_type":null,"reviewerName":"Seth Edward","reviewerCountry":""},{"review_id":1549265,"rating":"3.0","title":"Vatican Museums and Sistine Chapel so crowded.","message":"","author":"peter \u2013 United Kingdom","foreignLanguage":false,"date":"October 30, 2017","date_unformatted":{},"languageCode":"en","traveler_type":"friends","reviewerName":"peter","reviewerCountry":"United Kingdom"},{"review_id":1547756,"rating":"5.0","title":"Easy way to enter Vatican premisses, I would recomend to all-skip the","message":"","author":"Sanja \u2013 Croatia","foreignLanguage":false,"date":"October 30, 2017","date_unformatted":{},"languageCode":"en","traveler_type":"couple","reviewerName":"Sanja","reviewerCountry":"Croatia"},{"review_id":1546082,"rating":"4.0","title":"Overwhelming recommend a guided tour","message":"","author":"Sandra \u2013 Canada","foreignLanguage":false,"date":"October 29, 2017","date_unformatted":{},"languageCode":"en","traveler_type":"family_old","reviewerName":"Sandra","reviewerCountry":"Canada"},{"review_id":1545932,"rating":"5.0","title":"Excellent","message":"","author":"Ludovic \u2013 France","foreignLanguage":false,"date":"October 29, 2017","date_unformatted":{},"languageCode":"en","traveler_type":"family_old","reviewerName":"Ludovic","reviewerCountry":"France"},{"review_id":1544120,"rating":"4.0","title":"Good to save time but expensive comparing entrance fee and tour price!","message":"","author":"Jo\u00e3o \u2013 Portugal","foreignLanguage":false,"date":"October 29, 2017","date_unformatted":{},"languageCode":"en","traveler_type":"family_young","reviewerName":"Jo\u00e3o","reviewerCountry":"Portugal"},{"review_id":1539143,"rating":"1.0","title":"Boring, over-crowded, over-priced","message":"","author":"a GetYourGuide customer \u2013 Switzerland","foreignLanguage":false,"date":"October 28, 2017","date_unformatted":{},"languageCode":"en","traveler_type":"family_young","reviewerName":"Olivier","reviewerCountry":"Switzerland"},{"review_id":1538012,"rating":"3.0","title":"On your own.

The guide communicated very little during our wait and only when asked advised that we would set off a little late because company policy was to wait for all guests. On getting to the entrance to the museum the guide asked us all to enter and then when she had counted us all in (well not quite all as three went missing at this stage), she advised that children and students needed to go with her to validate their age. But on return, she started reading out each name and then hand out each ticket. More time spent on it.\nSo at 09.15, three guests missing and at least 15 guest remaining I asked if we could just have our tickets.
